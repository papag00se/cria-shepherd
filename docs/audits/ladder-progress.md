# Engagement ladder — progress

Truth: `python3 suite/engagement_status.py`. This file is for reading; that command is the status.

## Build — DONE

All six rungs gate, `tests/test_engagement_levels.py` passes, 4,624 tests green.

The contract is stated as OBSERVED BEHAVIOUR — a real cria server at each level, its own event log
read back — because the old claim ("assists off means the model on its own") lived in a docstring,
and a docstring cannot fail. Four assertions hold at every rung:

- no level lets a higher rung run;
- every logged mechanism is claimed by exactly one rung;
- levels 0-4 are identical with the planner on and off;
- every rung adds a mechanism its predecessor did not run.

### What each rung adds, measured from the fixture

| level | name | first appears here |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | pure proxy | wire translation only — `ctx.estimate`, `context.window` are measurement, not surgery |
| 1 | `TOOL_CALL_FIXES` | `massage.history_args_repaired`, `context.deorphaned` |
| 2 | `SIMPLE_TOOLS` | `writeproxy.advertised`, `toolmenu.cheatsheet` |
| 3 | `CONTEXT_FIXES` | `context.focus_trim`, `context.floor_skipped` |
| 4 | `DONE_REFUSALS_ENABLED` | `loop.start`, `loop.step_incomplete`, `loop.completion_probe` |
| 5 | `ASSISTS_ENABLED` | `loop.satisfaction_check`, `loop.satisfaction_gap_named` |

### Decisions worth keeping

**One owner per rung.** The tool layer was called identically from the chat path and the Responses
path; the gate went inside `_setup_translation` and the tool menu moved in with it. A level gate
written at two call sites is honoured at one of them the first time someone edits in a hurry.

**The trigger decides the rung, not the machinery.** `done_critic` and the completion probe are
level 4 because the model tried to stop. `satisfaction_check` and the periodic gate are level 5
because a turn counter fired. They call the same functions.

**The planner is an assist**, so below level 5 the loop always drives the synthetic single-item
path however `[planner] enabled` is set. That is what makes levels 0-4 planner-agnostic by
construction rather than by discipline — there is no plan-on branch left to diverge from.

**The periodic check is gated at its callers.** `_periodic_satisfaction` has a deliberate contract
that `blocked` is its first word, asserted against a Loop with no context at all. A level gate in
front of that broke six test files before the gate moved to the two call sites instead.

## Cells — 34 / 144

Judged usefulness per cell. `·` not run, `—` run but not judged.
