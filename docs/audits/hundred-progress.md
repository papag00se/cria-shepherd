# 100% campaign — live progress

**This file is the status.** Not a chat message, not a memory, not an intention. The goal it serves
is `docs/goals/hundred-goal.md`. The score grid it summarises is `docs/audits/battery-report.md`, which
rewrites itself after every cell.

**Target: 24 of 24 cells at 100%.** Currently 8.

## Cycle 1

**Phase: RUN** — started 2026-08-13, cell 11 of 24 in flight.

Driver: `python3 suite/cycle_run.py --start <n>` · log `docs/audits/cycle-run.log`

| 8 | cart-billing-go | nemotron-elastic | 0% | −20 | 16 | 51 | cria's own spilled fetch, saved as `…decimal.go` inside the workspace, was compiled by `go build ./...` — all five checks died on it |

| 10 | orders-api-py | qwen35 | 50% | −25 | 29 | 131 | model defect, reproduced: its `init()` runs `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` (a no-op on the pre-migration database the checker supplies) then `UPDATE orders SET status=…` on a column that was never added — service exits 1, two checks die with it |

Δ is percentage points against the previous run of the same cell, whatever prompt revision it was
earned against. Run ids are on the rows in `suite/results/results.jsonl`.

### Findings ledger — cycle 1

Seeded from work already done; the walk phase appends to it.

| rank | tier | finding | state | closed by |
|---:|---|---|---|---|
| — | 1 | spilled fetch keeps the URL's extension inside the workspace (`cria/webfetch.py:267`) | open — first in the fix phase | |
| — | 1 | steer author's free-prose contract (`_steer_or_none`) | open — deferred at 0.1% prevalence, needs its own pass | |
| — | 3 | cria's story of what happened ≠ cria's own record (5 sites) | open | |
| — | 3 | word-matching decides when to interrupt | open — needs prevalence first | |
| — | 3 | a refusal that leaves no way forward | open | |
| — | 3 | calls the model made that never happened | open | |

Ranks are assigned in the rank phase, once the walk has said how many cells each one cost.

### Log

- **2026-08-13** — cycle 1 run phase resumed at cell 9 after a driver-imposed `timeout 3000` killed
  `orders-api-py × gemma4` at 52 minutes of its own 60-minute wall. The cap is gone; the suite owns
  the only wall clock. The rerun finished in 21 minutes at 100%.
- **2026-08-13** — the campaign driver moved out of a session scratchpad into `suite/cycle_run.py`
  so a lost terminal cannot lose the loop.
- **2026-08-13** — the goal docs moved to `docs/goals/` and the port-fidelity audit to
  `docs/audits/`; every reference in `docs/` and `suite/` was repointed. Three comments under
  `cria/` still name the old path (`cria/loop.py:1757`, `cria/loop.py:3952`,
  `cria/probediscovery.py:854`). They are inert text and they wait for the fix phase — one code
  state per cycle applies to a comment as much as to a line that runs.
